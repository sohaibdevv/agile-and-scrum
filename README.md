# Agile And Scrum
# So, What's Agile?

Agile is an **iterative** and **collaborative** approach to software development. It emphasizes:

* Breaking down work into small, manageable **increments**.
* Fostering strong **teamwork**.
* Incorporating **continuous feedback** for adaptability.

The **Agile Manifesto** outlines the core values and principles that underpin the Agile philosophy.

## Scrum Explained

**Scrum** is a specific framework for implementing Agile principles. It structures work into fixed-length iterations called **Sprints** and defines key events:

* **Sprint Planning**: Defining the work for the upcoming sprint.
* **Daily Scrum**: A brief daily synchronization meeting for the development team.
* **Sprint Review**: Demonstrating the completed sprint deliverables.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflecting on the sprint to identify improvements.

## Why Agile Matters

Without Agile's **adaptive mindset**, projects risk becoming rigid and failing to meet evolving needs. Simply working sequentially isn't Agile; the ability to **embrace change** and **deliver value frequently** is essential. Implementing Agile roles without a fundamental shift in thinking and proper training is also ineffective.

## Key Agile Concepts

* **Kanban Board**: A visual workflow tool (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
* **User Story**: A concise description of a user need:
    > As a **[user]**, I want **[action]** so that **[benefit]**.
* **INVEST**: Criteria for well-formed user stories:
    * **I**ndependent
    * **N**egotiable
    * **V**aluable
    * **E**stimable
    * **S**mall
    * **T**estable
* **Story Points**: A relative measure of task complexity.
* **Sprint Plan**: The selected user stories for a sprint.
* **Sprint Review**: Presentation of completed sprint work.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: A post-sprint reflection for process improvement.

## Introduction to Kanban Boards

A **Kanban board** is a visual workflow management tool designed to help you visualize your work, limit work-in-progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency (or flow). It uses cards to represent tasks and columns to represent stages in a process. By visualizing the workflow, teams can easily see the status of every piece of work, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve their processes.

Think of it as a transparent and dynamic to-do list that evolves with your work. Instead of just listing tasks, it shows you where each task is in your workflow, from initial idea to completion. This visual representation provides valuable insights into your team's capacity and helps in making informed decisions about prioritizing and managing work.

Common elements of a Kanban board include:

* **Cards:** Represent individual tasks or work items. These cards often contain details like a brief description, assignee, and sometimes priority or due date.
* **Columns:** Represent different stages in your workflow. The names of these columns will vary depending on your process (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).
* **Swimlanes (Optional):** Horizontal lanes that can be used to categorize work by type, priority, team member, or any other relevant criteria.
* **WIP Limits (Optional but Recommended):** Constraints on the number of cards allowed in each column. Limiting WIP helps to focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, reducing context switching and improving flow.

By using a Kanban board, teams can gain a clear understanding of their workflow, identify and address bottlenecks, and ultimately deliver value more efficiently and predictably.
